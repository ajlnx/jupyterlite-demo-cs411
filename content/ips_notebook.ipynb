For example, a tree could be used to store information about how the files on your computer are stored. Imagine that your desktop is the root node of a tree. Each folder on your desktop would be a child node of the desktop node, the root, and each file inside of the folder would be a child node of the folder node and so on. Each individual file would be a leaf node since they wouldn't contain any files below them. This is one example of a secnario where trees proves to be a useful tool for storing data. In this secnario the data is organized in a **hierarchical** manner. Each folder is the parent of the folders and files it contains.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"cfc20f14b6bc4380ad70d2c9e46563be","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is a search algorithm?\n\nIn computer science, a search algorithm is a step-by-step process that is designed to find a piece of information stored in a data structure. In our case, a search algorithm is an algorithm that can locate a node in a tree that contains the information we are looking for. But how do we extract the information we want from a tree? Imagine you are on your desktop looking for a specific file that you've misplaced. To find the missing file, you click through each folder on the desktop and continue to open folders until you find your file. You have just searched a tree and extracted specific information! Along the same lines, we can formalize this process into a series of specific steps and rules for exploring the tree to come up with our first search algorithm, Depth First Search, or DFS.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"e5c018fb3d8f4c10b3bd1a134c15324c","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tree Traversal Algorithms\n\nThere are many ways to traverse a tree such that every node is visited once.

After all, both algorithms accomplish the same task in the end. However, the differences between BFS and DFS can make one algorithm better suited to a specific search problem depending on tha nature of the problem. For example, if the node we are trying to reach is located many levels below the root of the tree, using DFS to search the tree would return the answer more quickly as it goes down to the deeper levels of the tree more quickly than BFS. However, if one branch of the tree was very deep and did not contain the node we were looking for, BFS might return the answer more quickly as it would not have to traverse to the bottom of the branch before exploring other branches. In other words, BFS is better suited to the search problem when the node we are looking for is close to the root of the tree. Because of these different qualities, both BFS and DFS prove to be useful in solving various search problems, and thus it is useful to understand both in order to know which algorithm is suited for your own search problem.\n\n##### A Warning about DFS!!\n\nOne property of DFS that is important to understand is that **DFS is not guaranteed to reach a solution!**. Because of the depth first nature of DFS, it is possible for DFS to get stuck exploring node after node in an infinitely long branch of a tree thus preventing the algorithm from ever reaching the solution in another branch. This is an important pitfall of DFS that is addressed by BFS. If the solution node exists in the tree then BFS is guaranteed to find it while DFS is not!\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"4daf7dbd111c4a7f8a4a356e4ebfca53","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem Solving Activity\n\nThis problem solving activity's goals are to help participants explore the topic, facilitate learning, and make aware of knowledge gaps.\n\nPlease follow the following links below to visit the questions.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8681%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-47.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Question 1</a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8682%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-48.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Question 2</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8715%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-75.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Question 3</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8716%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-77.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Question 4</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8688%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fessay-57.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;\">Question 5</a>\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"0f9c06d6883442cdbaf5ae8009b6565d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=a2267166-7f53-4e1b-8086-8305c1f98a9d' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"6083581e2b4c4d7293a46d0b7e0b2e96","deepnote_persisted_session":{"createdAt":"2022-12-17T20:46:32.821Z"},"deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
