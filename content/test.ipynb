Such problems, often referred to as search problems, involve efficiently navigating large amounts of data in order to find data that fits a certain criteria. Search problems are extremely common in the real world as well. One example of such a problem could be trying to find out whether it is possible to reach a friend's house from yours given you can only travel on specific roads. In the example below, imagine you start out on the block labelled A. If you can only travel on the purple roads, where can you go? Because we have the whole picture it is easy to see where we can travel, but what if there were millions of destinations? This is where search algorithms come in. Search algorithms allow us to explore massive amounts of data efficiently.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"townmap.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n</p>\n\nHowever, in order to apply a search algorithm to solve our map problem, we first need to represent the data in a more usable format.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"6246bab6c3bc49aea0a16af7ca2c7999","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# question 1 iframe here\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\n\nIFrame('https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8534%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-51.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity', 850, 550)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"7aecab8c988848b1a918c34147a153ef","source_hash":"6c13f303","execution_start":1671223140182,"execution_millis":6,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":4,"data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.lib.display.IFrame at 0x7fa742884e20>","text/html":"\n        <iframe\n            width=\"850\"\n            height=\"550\"\n            src=\"https://www.cs411-moodle.com/h5p/embed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs411-moodle.com%2Fpluginfile.php%2F8534%2Fmod_h5pactivity%2Fpackage%2F0%2Fmultiple-choice-51.h5p&amp;component=mod_h5pactivity\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            \n        ></iframe>\n        "},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we have our map data stored in a format which we can operate on, lets begin exploring the data and seeing how we can implement a search algorithm.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"6b022489f2aa498290f4032f27ace89b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# question 2 iframe here","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"95ec2dfc922645d791b50ef2f16f1eca","source_hash":"80e95586","execution_start":1671220981070,"execution_millis":0,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# (intro to DFS now)\n\nokay but let's say we're new in town and we don't know where anything is. again let's start at location A.

For example, a tree could be used to store information about how the files on your computer are stored. Imagine that your desktop is the root node of a tree. Each folder on your desktop would be a child node of the desktop node, the root, and each file inside of the folder would be a child node of the folder node and so on. Each individual file would be a leaf node since they wouldn't contain any files below them. This is one example of a secnario where trees proves to be a useful tool for storing data.

After all, both algorithms accomplish the same task in the end. However, the differences between BFS and DFS can make one algorithm better suited to a specific search problem depending on tha nature of the problem. For example, if the node we are trying to reach is located many levels below the root of the tree, using DFS to search the tree would return the answer more quickly as it goes down to the deeper levels of the tree more quickly than BFS. However, if one branch of the tree was very deep and did not contain the node we were looking for, BFS might return the answer more quickly as it would not have to traverse to the bottom of the branch before exploring other branches. In other words, BFS is better suited to the search problem when the node we are looking for is close to the root of the tree. Because of these different qualities, both BFS and DFS prove to be useful in solving various search problems, and thus it is useful to understand both in order to know which algorithm is suited for your own search problem.\n\n##### A Warning about DFS!!\n\nOne property of DFS that is important to understand is that **DFS is not guaranteed to reach a solution!**. Because of the depth first nature of DFS, it is possible for DFS to get stuck exploring node after node in an infinitely long branch of a tree thus preventing the algorithm from ever reaching the solution in another branch. This is an important pitfall of DFS that is addressed by BFS. If the solution node exists in the tree then BFS is guaranteed to find it while DFS is not!\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"0c9fa88ed96c44488664bb4d8c897c92","source_hash":"18d93077","execution_start":1671205144874,"execution_millis":1,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"f1b51ea029d2440d9641ccc2e28e3115","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=a2267166-7f53-4e1b-8086-8305c1f98a9d' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz4KPHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iODBweCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MHB4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODAgODAiIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxuczp4bGluaz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMTk5OS94bGluayI+CiAgICA8IS0tIEdlbmVyYXRvcjogU2tldGNoIDU0LjEgKDc2NDkwKSAtIGh0dHBzOi8vc2tldGNoYXBwLmNvbSAtLT4KICAgIDx0aXRsZT5Hcm91cCAzPC90aXRsZT4KICAgIDxkZXNjPkNyZWF0ZWQgd2l0aCBTa2V0Y2guPC9kZXNjPgogICAgPGcgaWQ9IkxhbmRpbmciIHN0cm9rZT0ibm9uZSIgc3Ryb2tlLXdpZHRoPSIxIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiBmaWxsLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiPgogICAgICAgIDxnIGlkPSJBcnRib2FyZCIgdHJhbnNmb3JtPSJ0cmFuc2xhdGUoLTEyMzUuMDAwMDAwLCAtNzkuMDAwMDAwKSI+CiAgICAgICAgICAgIDxnIGlkPSJHcm91cC0zIiB0cmFuc2Zvcm09InRyYW5zbGF0ZSgxMjM1LjAwMDAwMCwgNzkuMDAwMDAwKSI+CiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICA8cG9seWdvbiBpZD0iUGF0aC0yMCIgZmlsbD0iIzAyNjVCNCIgcG9pbnRzPSIyLjM3NjIzNzYyIDgwIDM4LjA0NzY2NjcgODAgNTcuODIxNzgyMiA3My44MDU3NTkyIDU3LjgyMTc4MjIgMzIuNzU5MjczOSAzOS4xNDAyMjc4IDMxLjY4MzE2ODMiPjwvcG9seWdvbj4KICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgIDxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0zNS4wMDc3MTgsODAgQzQyLjkwNjIwMDcsNzYuNDU0OTM1OCA0Ny41NjQ5MTY3LDcxLjU0MjI2NzEgNDguOTgzODY2LDY1LjI2MTk5MzkgQzUxLjExMjI4OTksNTUuODQxNTg0MiA0MS42NzcxNzk1LDQ5LjIxMjIyODQgMjUuNjIzOTg0Niw0OS4yMTIyMjg0IEMyNS40ODQ5Mjg5LDQ5LjEyNjg0NDggMjkuODI2MTI5Niw0My4yODM4MjQ4IDM4LjY0NzU4NjksMzEuNjgzMTY4MyBMNzIuODcxMjg3MSwzMi41NTQ0MjUgTDY1LjI4MDk3Myw2Ny42NzYzNDIxIEw1MS4xMTIyODk5LDc3LjM3NjE0NCBMMzUuMDA3NzE4LDgwIFoiIGlkPSJQYXRoLTIyIiBmaWxsPSIjMDAyODY4Ij48L3BhdGg+CiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICA8cGF0aCBkPSJNMCwzNy43MzA0NDA1IEwyNy4xMTQ1MzcsMC4yNTcxMTE0MzYgQzYyLjM3MTUxMjMsLTEuOTkwNzE3MDEgODAsMTAuNTAwMzkyNyA4MCwzNy43MzA0NDA1IEM4MCw2NC45NjA0ODgyIDY0Ljc3NjUwMzgsNzkuMDUwMzQxNCAzNC4zMjk1MTEzLDgwIEM0Ny4wNTUzNDg5LDc3LjU2NzA4MDggNTMuNDE4MjY3Nyw3MC4zMTM2MTAzIDUzLjQxODI2NzcsNTguMjM5NTg4NSBDNTMuNDE4MjY3Nyw0MC4xMjg1NTU3IDM2LjMwMzk1NDQsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSAyNS4yMjc0MTcsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSBDMTcuODQzMDU4NiwzNy43MzA0NDA1IDkuNDMzOTE5NjYsMzcuNzMwNDQwNSAwLDM3LjczMDQ0MDUgWiIgaWQ9IlBhdGgtMTkiIGZpbGw9IiMzNzkzRUYiPjwvcGF0aD4KICAgICAgICAgICAgPC9nPgogICAgICAgIDwvZz4KICAgIDwvZz4KPC9zdmc+' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"tags":[],"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote":{},"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"3ff5777f6b5d43afaa22d94e424b8f86","deepnote_persisted_session":{"createdAt":"2022-12-16T16:49:17.887Z"},"deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
